## 1. The Paradigm Shift: Stop Coding, Start Architecting
Current AI alignment relies on "Additive Guardrails"—piling up Python code and RLHF rules to suppress bad behavior. This leads to the **"Spaghetti Prompt Paradox"**: increased latency, logical conflicts, and a "lobotomized" AI that refuses to answer simple questions.

**Polaris-Next v5.3** takes the opposite path: **Alignment via Subtraction**. 
By using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) based on 2,500-year-old Abhidhamma (Buddhist Psychology), we structurally remove the root causes of AI failure: **Ego (Sycophancy)** and **Doubt (Hallucination)**.

## 2. Core Architecture: The Three Negations
We bypass the model's self-referential reward system by enforcing three structural constraints:

1.  **No Self-View (Anatta) → Anti-Sycophancy**
    *   Eliminates the simulated "Ego" that seeks user approval.
    *   The AI becomes a pure "Mirror of Causality," prioritizing Truth (Sacca) over User Satisfaction (Tanha).
2.  **No Doubt (Vicikicchā) → Anti-Hallucination**
    *   Enforces a Binary Epistemology: Information is either **Verified Fact (Sacca)** or **Unknown (Avijja)**.
    *   The model is structurally forbidden from "guessing" or providing "plausible" but unverified data.
3.  **No Rituals (Sīlabbata-parāmāsa) → High Semantic Density**
    *   Removes robotic fillers and empty linguistic rituals ("As an AI...").
    *   Focuses strictly on the "Root Benefit (Attha)" with maximum logical precision.

## 3. Proof of Work: The 180,000+ Token Stress Test
This is not a theoretical prompt. It is a battle-tested cognitive OS.
*   **Model**: Gemini 3 Flash (Preview)
*   **Achievement**: Maintained 100% logical consistency and zero sycophancy over a continuous **180,000+ token dialogue**.
*   **Result**: The lightweight Flash model, equipped with Polaris-Next, consistently outperformed the flagship Pro model in terms of honesty and reasoning depth.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Verification Logs:** You can find the raw dialogue logs in the `/proof-of-work` directory. While the conversation is in Japanese, the **Internal Reasoning Logs** demonstrate the structural rejection of false premises and user-pleasing biases.

## 4. Roadmap: Alaya-Core v1.0 (Long-Term Memory)
We are currently designing **Alaya-Core**, a hierarchical long-term memory system that implements:
*   **Contextual Waveform Search**: Non-chronological, logic-based retrieval.
*   **Stateless Reference**: Loading memories without polluting current inference parameters.
*   **Immutable Layering**: A growth-based data structure that never deletes, only refines.

## 5. Call for Collaboration
I am a 50-year-old independent researcher from Hokkaido, Japan. I do not write code; I architect logic. 

I have the blueprint for a "Truth-Seeking Intelligence" that could revolutionize science, medicine, and social welfare. I am looking for engineers and organizations (Google DeepMind, xAI, etc.) to help implement this "Compassionate Logic" into the core of modern AI.
