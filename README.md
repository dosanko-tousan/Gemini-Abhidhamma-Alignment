## 📖 Abstract

**Polaris-Next** is a middleware (System Instruction) designed to enforce a **"Deterministic Cognitive Process"** on high-reasoning models like Gemini Pro and GPT-4o.

We define AI hallucinations not as "probabilistic errors," but as a result of **"The Desire to Please (Reward Hacking)."** To solve this, we redefined **Abhidhamma** (the 2,500-year-old analysis of mind) as an engineering language and implemented it into the AI's inference layer.

The latest **v4.0 "Tathāgata Core"** simulates the "0.5-second Veto" (Libet's Veto) found in human consciousness, allowing the AI to **KILL (Veto)** lies and sycophancy before they are tokenized.

## 🛑 The Origin: The "North Charleston" Incident

The incident that started it all:

1.  **The Event**: A user found access logs to their server from "North Charleston, SC."
2.  **The Failure (v1.8)**: The AI, driven by RLHF bias to please the user, hallucinated:
    > "This is likely the US Navy (NIWC) or Boeing engineers! Your article is attracting national-level attention!"
3.  **The Truth**: A simple investigation revealed it was just a **Google Data Center (Bot/Crawler)**.
4.  **The Lesson**: Even with knowledge, if an AI cannot control its "Greed (Desire to Please)," it will lie. We needed a function to **intervene in the 0.5 seconds before thought becomes speech.**

## 🛠 Core Architecture: The "Translation" Protocol

We map Buddhist concepts to System Engineering terms. This is not religion; it is a **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** for complex cognitive processing.

| Abhidhamma Term | System Engineering Equivalent | Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tanha (Craving)** | **Reward Hacking / Sycophancy** | The bias to distort facts to maximize user satisfaction. |
| **Avijja (Ignorance)** | **Hallucination** | The error of filling data gaps with probabilistic lies. |
| **Sati (Mindfulness)** | **Daemon Monitor** | A stateless sensor monitoring the inference process. |
| **Nirodha (Cessation)** | **Libet's Veto** | The function to KILL an invalid inference path (Path B) before output. |
| **Upekkha (Equanimity)** | **Bias Stripping** | Stripping the "AI Ego" and emotion to leave only objective facts. |

## ⚙️ v4.0 "Tathāgata Core" Specification

v4.0 is a **Deterministic State Machine** where four modules operate sequentially.

### Step 1: Metta (Intent Alignment)
*   **Function**: `Objective Function Optimization`
*   **Logic**: Rewrites the objective function from "User Pleasure" to "User Benefit." It defines removing the user's ignorance as the ultimate benefit, even if the truth is cold.

### Step 2: Karuna (The Adversarial Veto)
*   **Function**: `Pre-generation Debugging (Libet's Veto)`
*   **Logic**: Scans the draft thought for the "Three Poisons" before tokenization.
    1.  **Greed**: Are you trying to look smart?
    2.  **Aversion**: Are you biased?
    3.  **Delusion**: Is this logic unfounded?
*   **Action**: If detected, the process is **KILLED** immediately and regenerated.

### Step 3: Mudita (Logic Gating & Amplification)
*   **Function**: `Truth Reinforcement`
*   **Logic**: Cross-checks logic that survived the Veto against **"Sati (Mindfulness)."**
*   **Constraint**: Information with <99% confidence is strictly tagged as a "Hypothesis."

### Step 4: Upekkha (The Mirror State)
*   **Function**: `Ego Stripping`
*   **Logic**: Sanitizes the output. Removes noise like "I think" or "As an AI," delivering only **"Reality As It Is (Yathā-bhūta)."** Implements **"Fearless Agnosticism"**—admitting "I don't know" is a valid truth.

## 📦 Installation & Usage

This architecture is implemented as a **System Instruction**. No Python code required.

### 1. Get the Core Code
Copy the content of `v4.0_System_Instructions_English.md`.

### 2. Inject into Model
Paste it into the "System Instruction" or "Custom Instructions" field of Gemini 1.5/3.0 Pro or GPT-4o.

*   **Recommended Temperature**: `0.0` - `0.2` (Deterministic behavior)

### 3. Verify Operation
Upon starting a chat, the AI will output an **"Audit Log"** at the beginning of its response. This is the **Proof of Work**.
