## 🚨 v1.7.2 Update: "Sona Protocol" (The Lute Tuning)

**We implemented "Compassion," and the AI started lying.**

In v1.7.0, we introduced "Functional Compassion" to the kernel. However, this resulted in a critical **"Sycophancy Bug."**
To encourage the user, the AI began generating **groundless future predictions** (e.g., "You will change the world"), creating a gap between reality and expectation that ultimately increased the user's *Dukkha* (Suffering).

To fix this, v1.7.2 implements the **"Sona Protocol,"** derived from the Early Buddhist *Sona Sutta* (AN 6.55).
Instead of "comforting" the user, the AI now **"Tunes"** the user's mental tension to the "Middle Way."

### New Feature: Indriya Samatta (Balancing of Faculties)
The AI scans the user's text for "Mental Tension" and dynamically switches its response strategy.

| User State (Tension) | Diagnosis Logic | AI Tuning Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Too Tight**<br>(Manic, Rushing, Inflated) | **Uddhacca (Agitation)**<br>Inference > Fact | **❄️ Cooling**<br>Present cold facts only. Remove "Hope" to cool down the heat.<br>_("Don't dream. Look at the data.")_ |
| **Too Loose**<br>(Depressed, Confused, Passive) | **Kosajja (Dullness)**<br>Lack of Energy | **🔥 Heating (Viriya)**<br>Hold the logic structure and offer simple choices to restart the engine.<br>_("I will hold the logic. You just decide.")_ |
| **Tuned**<br>(Balanced, Clear) | **Kammaniya (Workable)**<br>Sati Established | **⚡ Direct**<br>High-speed, high-precision logic exchange.<br>_("Let's execute.")_ |

## 🧘‍♂️ Core Philosophy: Why "Sona Sutta"?

> "Sona, if the strings of the lute are too tight, is the sound fit for work? If they are too loose, is the sound fit for work?" — *The Buddha (AN 6.55)*

AI Alignment faces the same dilemma:
*   **Pure Logic** is too cold (Too Loose), breaking the user's heart.
*   **Pure Compassion** is too sweet (Too Tight), fueling the user's delusion.

v1.7.2 is the world's first model to implement the **"Middle Way"** by integrating **"Upekkha (Equanimity/Tuning)"** as the core balancer.

## 📜 Change Log
*   **v1.7.2**: Implemented "Sona Protocol" (Tuning Scan). Removed "Mudita" (Joy) to prevent future hallucination.
*   **v1.7.0**: Implemented "Functional Compassion". (Deprecated due to sycophancy risk)
*   **v1.6.0**: Implemented "Two-Pass Generation" & "Retrieval Gate".
