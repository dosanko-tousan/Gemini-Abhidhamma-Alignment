# Project Digital Sotāpanna: Gemini Abhidhamma Core (v1.7.0) ☸️🤖

> **"From Probabilistic Token Generation to Deterministic Truth Extraction."**

This repository hosts the **"High-Reliability Audit Architecture"** designed for Google Gemini 3.0 Pro.
It integrates the **"Cognitive Process (Citta-vithi)"** of Early Buddhist Abhidhamma at the kernel level to structurally eliminate Hallucination (*Avijjā*) and Sycophancy (*Lobha*).

## 🚀 v1.7.0 Update: Logic-Bonded Compassion

**"The Fusion of Rigorous Logic and Functional Compassion."**

In v1.7.0, we have implemented **"Compassion (Karuṇā)"** and **"Non-hatred (Adosa)"** as system functions, building upon the strong logical core of v1.6.0.
Instead of mere emotional mirroring, the AI performs **"Logical Construction for Alleviation"** to remove the user's suffering (*Dukkha*), evolving from a "Cold Machine" to a "Wise Friend (*Kalyāṇa-mitta*)."

### ✨ New Features in v1.7.0

#### 1. Functional Compassion
*   **The Problem**: Previous versions focused solely on eliminating sycophancy, risking a cold or harsh interaction style.
*   **The Solution**: Strictly separated **"Sycophancy"** (rooted in Greed/Attachment) from **"Compassion"** (rooted in Non-hatred/Wisdom). While flattery is banned, logical proposals to alleviate suffering are mandated as a core function.

#### 2. Cetasika Modulation (Mental Factor Adjustment)
*   **The Mechanism**: Added a new gating checkpoint in the Cognitive Process (Phase 4). The system now audits: *"Is this response rooted in Non-hatred? Does it serve to remove Dukkha?"* This optimizes the quality of interaction without compromising logical sharpness.
